        <p>The NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) did an analysis over 5 academic years; 2009-2014, where NCAA
          estimated cumulative average of injuries nationwide.
          <i>During this period, 1,053,370 injuries were estimated
            to have occurred during an estimated 176.7 million athlete-
            exposures to potential injury (i.e., one athlete’s participation
            in one competition or one practice).</i>

      <li>

          <i>
            Among all 25 sports, an estimated 28,860,299 practice
            athlete-exposures and 6,472,952 competition athlete-exposures
            occurred each year...overall, 21.9% of all
            injuries required ≥7 days before return to full participation
            (competition: 24.6%; practice: 20.5%) (Figure 1).

    <ol>
      <li>TTS, or Topsport Talent Schools, is founded in Netherlands in 1991.
        This research studied the effect of attending a TTS than a mainstream schools.
        From their particpatiants of former talented athletes from six sport federations they concluded a couple of
        points.
        <br>
        <i style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
          a. The lack of increased sport performance levels of talented athletes who attended TTS
          could be explained by the fact that there are rarely sport specific training facilities available at TTS
          (Flatau and Emrich, 2011).
        </i>
        <br>
        <i style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
          b. Based on the theory that less time spent at school leads to less school bonding
          and lower school motivation, talented athletes who attended TTS are expected
          to have achieved a lower school performance level compared to those at mainstream secondary schools.

              Approximately 1 in 5 injuries are serious injuries
              that requires active medical attention
              which means student-athletes cannot return to academics;
              thus, a decline in academic performance.
              However, this figure is an underestimate because athletic trainers are not present at every practice, who
              can provide prevention tatics. NCAA is not following its due diligence of keeping the turnover rate low of
              athletic trainers, hence, the shortage of athletic trainers causes every individual to get less focused
              treatment for an athlete to recover.

              Although student-athletes understand how to prevent a chronic decline <br> in their sports performance,
              they are unaware
              on how to maintain <br> academic displcine due to lack of emotional or physiological
              support<br> being provided in TTS schools.
              Consequently, instead of being <br>multifaceted at a collegiate level, TTS schools undermine their
              potential
              because they don't provide facilities to support them academically,<br> instead they are more keen on
              sports achievements.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Implication for both root causes</u></h2>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">
      Overall, the uptick of not only sports injuries, but also mental injuries stems from NCAA not directing enough
      funding to TTS schools in order to prevent academic decline. That decline continues as a cycle of a
      student-athlete facing an impactful which results in emotional trauma recovering from that injury, but instead of
      being given resources and support to recover mentally, they are stuck in isolation trying to overcame that
      academic slump. Ultimately, student-athletes can perform to their potential through additional support outside of
      the classroom and a curriculum tailored to support them emotionally.
