  <h2>Evidence</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has reported an increase in suicide
        in student-athletes, causing it to be the fourth leading cause of death of college athletes, this has
        enhanced a focus on all student-athlete’s mental health. Wolanin and Hong stated “6.3% of
        student-athletes met the criteria for clinically significant depression and 24% had low moods
        considered “clinically relevant”.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> '“Stress can be detrimental to the
            student's mental and physical health as well as to sport performance.”' </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Maloney and McCormick (1993) conducted a study at Clemson University of
        595 student athletes in determination of finding the effect of athletics on academic success.
        They found that academically, athletes do three-tenths of a grade point worse than regular
        students in three out of 10 classes. They also discovered athletes in revenue sports are
        lagging behind their peers. Athletes in football and basketball do one-tenth of a grade point
        worse than their fellow student athletes (Maloney & McCormick, 1993).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>*Note this evidence can be attributed to apart of my solution </h5>
      <p>
        In an eight-month quasi-experimental, randomized treatment field study, an attribution-based motivation
        treatment (Attributional Retraining: AR) was administered to student athletes (n = 185) and non-athletes (n =
        281) who differed in perceived control beliefs (±1 SD) in a two-semester, online course. Simple slope regression
        analyses revealed the AR (vs. no-AR) treatment assisted competitive student athletes who had low control beliefs
        by increasing perceived success in the course (b = 0.84, p = 0.038), post-treatment test performance (b = 11.68,
        p = 0.001), year-end course grades (b = 6.32, p = 0.017), and by reducing course withdrawals (b = −1.00, p =
        0.034, OR = 0.37)
